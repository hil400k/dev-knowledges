The entry (learning) into Angular is tougher than React.  
React doesnâ€™t come with a routing library.  
For React You also need to be familiar with state management libraries like MobX or Redux.  
React doesn't have provided code structure.  
Angular uses real DOM; react uses Virtual DOM; that`s why React is better for 
freequent updates  
Angular: 2-way binding; React: 1-way binding;
